## Description

CASA0005 is an MSc level module created and delivered by Andrew MacLachlan and Adam Dennett from the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), University College London (UCL).  


This GitHub repository generates the CASA0005 Geographic Information Systems and Science student practical handbook which can be found at: https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0005repo/

## File structure 

Within each practical the associated data is stored in the prac(number)_data folder for example prac2_data. The image folders simply stored all the graphics used within the practical book to explain concepts/provide examples.
