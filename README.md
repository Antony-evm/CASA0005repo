## Description

CASA0005 is an MSc level module created and delivered by [Andrew MacLachlan](https://twitter.com/andymaclachlan) and [Adam Dennett](https://twitter.com/adam_dennett) from the [Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/), University College London (UCL).  

The module is a combination of lectures and practicals, with this repository holding the code to generate the student practical handbook, which can be found at: https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0005repo

The content covers the principles underlying the conception, representation/measurement and analysis of spatial phenomena. As such, it presents an overview of the core organising concepts and techniques of Geographic Information Systems, and the software and analysis systems that are integral to their effective deployment in spatial analysis. It is concerned with unearthing and understanding the importance of spatial data in a range of applied contexts.

## Target audience

The practical material has primarily been developed for MSc (or MRes) level students who have little or no background in GIS, spatial analysis or the R data science language, but have studied in a related field such as: geography, architecture, computer science, statistics, mathematics or planning.

However, there is no requirement to have any background in these disciplines to go through the material and anyone with an interest in spatial analysis in the R data science programming language will be able to successfully complete the practicals.

## Annual updates

Provided below are brief descriptions of the main annual updates to the practical material.

Improvements made 2021 - 2022:

1. Removed more non geographic content such as dashboards
1. Removed:
  * Practical 8 on online mapping + more descriptive stats
  * Elements of GitHub practical 
  * Instructions on citing papers in RMarkdown - this is now on the dissertation template. 
  * Interpolation from the first raster practical 
1. Added more info on spatial weights and deciding between Spatial Error Models (SEMs) and Spatially Lagged Models (SLMs)
1. Added more info on creating GWR bandwidths. 
1. Mark scheme revision for an open book exam not written assignment.
1. Github classroom for submission of the exam.

Improvements made 2020 - 2021:

1. All of ArcGIS content removed and replaced with R and QGIS (open source)
1. Set clear weekly homework tasks 
1. Custom styling of the bookdown website
1. Revision of nearly all code, moving towards the `tidyverse` and piped (`%>%`) syntax
1. More focus on `dplyr` and other data wrangling/tidying tools (e.g. `Janitor`)

Improvements made 2019 - 2020:

1. All material moved to bookdown
1. Majority of practicals moved to R
