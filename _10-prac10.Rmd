# Introduction 

In this practical we are going to preliminary stages of a mini-investigation. Since 2015 the law has capped short-term lets in London at 90 nights per year. However, this is very hard to enforce due to a lack of data and extensive evidence required to prove that the limit has been exceeded. This has been recently reflected in the [Housing Research Note 2020/04: Short-term and holiday letting in London](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/housing_research_note_4-_short-term_and_holiday_letting_in_london.pdf) by the Greater London Authority (GLA):

>"there are signs that short-term letting platforms are becoming increasingly commercialised and there are concerns that removing housing supply from the market to offer it for short-term letting could be exacerbating Londonâ€™s housing shortage."

The author, Georgie Cosh, was also kind enough to share some of the code used for this report. Guess what! They used R! Have a look at their code in the R file called GLA_airbnb_analysis in the prac8_data folder.

Whilst Air bnb have implemented a system the removes listings once they have been rented for 90 days per year unless an appropraite permit is in place we want to interactively visualise the the number of air bnb lettings (and hotels for comparison) per borough as a starting point. This could then be used to undertake further investigation into boroughs with high short term lets, for example exploring other websites to see if the properties are listed and jointly exceed 90 days or optimising localised monitoring. As these rules only apply to entire homes we will only extract only these, and for monitoring purposes (e.g. random annual inspections) those are availbale for 365 days of the year.

We will now explore several ways to do this...

::: {.infobox .tip data-latex="{note}"}
The report by Cosh (2020) goes a bit further than this and implements an occupancy model (based on a number of assumptions) to estimate the number of nights a Air bnb is rented out for, so check it out, perhaps an idea for your final project.

# RPubs

One of the most straight forward publishing tools is RPubs. It takes an ```.Rmd``` and directly uploads it to rpubs.com --- all files are publically available on this website.

1. To start with you need to make a free account. Go to: https://rpubs.com/users/new and register

1. Create a new project in RStudio and open a new R Markdown file (File > New File > R Markdown)

1. You'll see that the file is automatically populated with some information, have a read through it then click the Knit icon ...

```{r prac8_knitt, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800pt", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('prac8_images/knitt.png') 
```

1. Let's make some changes to your ```.Rmd```. Delete all the text and code except from header information (that is enclosed by three dashes at the top of the file)

1. Insert a new code chunk (go back to [RMarkdown] if you need a refresher)...

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "450pt", fig.align='center', cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics('allisonhorst_images/rmarkdown_wizards.png')
```

...Add add some code of your choice from either a previous practical or your own work. As it's a new project you'll have to either copy the data into your project folder or set the working directory ```setwd()```. If it's all online data that you've loaded directly from the web into R, this shouldn't be an issue. I'm going to use the interactive map we made in practical 5 (the [Advanced interactive map] section).....Here is the code i've put in my chunk:

```{r prac8_airbnb_hotel, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(leafpop)
library(leaflet)
library(tmaptools)
library(tidyverse)

OSM <- st_read(here::here("prac5_data",
                          "greater-london-latest-free.shp", 
                          "gis_osm_pois_a_free_1.shp")) %>%
  st_transform(., 27700) %>%
  #select hotels only
  filter(fclass == 'hotel')

Londonborough <- st_read(here::here("Prac1_data",
                                    "statistical-gis-boundaries-london", 
                                    "ESRI", 
                                    "London_Borough_Excluding_MHW.shp"))%>%
  st_transform(., 27700)

Airbnb <- read_csv("prac5_data/listings.csv") %>%
  st_as_sf(., coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), 
                   crs = 4326) %>%
    st_transform(., 27700)%>%
    #select entire places that are available all year
    filter(room_type == 'Entire home/apt' & availability_365 =='365')


# make a function for the join
# hint all you have to do is replace data1 and data2
# with the data you want to use

Joinfun <- function(data1, data2){

output<- data1%>%
  st_join(Londonborough,.)%>%
  add_count(GSS_CODE, name="hotels_in_borough") 

  return(output)
}

# use the function for hotels
Hotels <- Joinfun(OSM, Londonborough)

# then for airbnb
Airbnb <- Joinfun(Airbnb, Londonborough)

# now try to arrange the plots with tmap
breaks = c(0, 5, 12, 26, 57, 286) 

#change the column name from hotels_in_borough for the legend
Hotels <- Hotels %>%
  dplyr::rename(`Accomodation count` = hotels_in_borough)

Airbnb <- Airbnb %>%
  dplyr::rename(`Accomodation count` = hotels_in_borough)


Airbnb_count <- Airbnb %>% 
  count(GSS_CODE)
Hotels_count <- Hotels %>% 
  count(NAME)

#join data
Joined <- Airbnb_count%>%
  st_join(., Hotels_count, join = st_equals)%>%
  st_transform(., 4326)%>%
  rename(`Airbnb count` = `n.x`, 
         `GSS Code`= GSS_CODE,
         `Borough`=NAME,
         `Hotel count` = `n.y`) 

popupairbnb <-Joined %>%
  st_drop_geometry()%>%
  dplyr::select(`Airbnb count`, Borough)%>%
  popupTable()

popuphotel <-Joined %>%
  st_drop_geometry()%>%
  dplyr::select(`Hotel count`, Borough)%>%
  popupTable()

tmap_mode("view")

# set the colour palettes using our previously defined breaks


pal1 <- Joined %>%
  colorBin(palette = "YlOrRd", domain=.$`Airbnb count`, bins=breaks)

pal1 <-colorBin(palette = "YlOrRd", domain=Joined$`Airbnb count`, bins=breaks)

pal2 <- Joined %>%
  colorBin(palette = "YlOrRd", domain=.$`Hotel count`, bins=breaks)


map<- leaflet(Joined) %>%
  # add basemap options
  addTiles(group = "OSM (default)") %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.Toner, group = "Toner") %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.TonerLite, group = "Toner Lite") %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron, group = "CartoDB")%>%
  
  #add our polygons, linking to the tables we just made
  addPolygons(color="white", 
              weight = 2,
              opacity = 1,
              dashArray = "3",
              popup = popupairbnb,
              fillOpacity = 0.7,
              fillColor = ~pal2(`Airbnb count`),
              group = "Airbnb")%>%
  
  addPolygons(fillColor = ~pal2(`Hotel count`), 
              weight = 2,
              opacity = 1,
              color = "white",
              dashArray = "3",
              popup = popupairbnb,
              fillOpacity = 0.7,group = "Hotels")%>%
  # add a legend
  addLegend(pal = pal2, values = ~`Hotel count`, group = c("Airbnb","Hotel"), 
            position ="bottomleft", title = "Accomodation count") %>%
  # specify layers control
  addLayersControl(
    baseGroups = c("OSM (default)", "Toner", "Toner Lite", "CartoDB"),
    overlayGroups = c("Airbnb", "Hotels"),
    options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)
  )

# plot the map
map
```

1. Add some text at the start of your ```.Rmd``` you can include titles and subtitle using # followed by a space, a second level subtitle would be ##, and third ###

```{r prac8_titles, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Title
## Second sub title
### Third sub title
```

7. Save the file, Knitt it to HTML, this should be default and specified in the header --- enclosed by three dashes.

8. Once knitted you can easily publish the file to Ppubs using the Publish icon either in the viewer pane or the toolbar area (by run)

```{r prac8_publish, echo=FALSE, out.width = "200pt", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('prac8_images/publish.png') 
```

Now how about adding a few design features...i've changed my header section to...

```{r prac8_header, eval=FALSE}
---
title: "publishexample"
output:
  html_document:
    theme: yeti
    smart: true
    highlight: textmate
    toc: true
    number_sections: true
    toc_float:
      collapsed: false
      smooth_scroll: true
---
```

9. Knit and then publish again...you'll notice a few aesthetic changes

# RMarkdown site generator 

## Set the file structure

RPubs are useful but what if you wanted to make a full site with different tabs for introduction, methodology, results and recommedations...one way is to use the RMarkdown site generator hosted on GitHub

RMarkdown site generator is useful as it does not require any third-party add ons like blogdown which is reliant on the hugo site generator

To make a site you'll need the following to be within your project:

(a) A configuration file with the filename ```_site.yml```

(b) An ```index.Rmd```

(c) Any other ```.Rmd``` files you want to create into pages on the site

For the site to work you only require (a) and (b)....but that would be a pretty boring site...

11. In your new project add two new RMarkdown files called:
* ```_site.yml``` 
* ```index.Rmd``` 


```{r prac8_sitegenerator, echo=FALSE, out.width = "500pt", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('prac8_images/rsitegenerator.png') 
```

12. In the ```_site.yml``` remove all code and add the following

```{r prac8_yml, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
name: "Hello world"
output_dir: "."
navbar:
  title: "My example website"
  left:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "About"
      href: publishexample.html
```

## Link to GitHub

There are two ways to do this....

### GitHub first

This is the 'easy' way as you woould repeat the steps in [Practical 4][Git, GitHub and RMarkdown] by firstly making a new repository on GitHub then loading a new project in RStudio, linking that to GitHub and copying all your files into your new project from the exisiting one. 

### GitHub last

So if you already have a RStudio project...like we do...we can link this to GitHub but the steps are a bit more invovled and there are several ways to acheive it --- as with most things in R.

13. Make a Git repo in RStudio. Go to Tools > Project Options > Git/SVN and select Git under Version control system and initialize a new repository, then restart RStudio. The Git tab should appear..

14. Next we need to make a new repository on GitHub. Go to GitHub, login and make a new repository. Make sure that it is **empty** with no README.. you should have something similar to this appear:

```{r prac8_newrepo, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800pt", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('prac8_images/gitnewrepo.png') 
```

15. Clone the repository by copying the HTTPS 

```{r prac8_HTTPS, echo=FALSE, out.width = "700pt", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('prac8_images/HTTPS.png') 
```

16. Make one local commit. Under the Git tab > Diff > Stage the files > Add a commit message and click commit

17. Now we need to connect our local repository to the GitHub one. So Under the Git tab you'll the new brach button (two purple boxes linked to a white box)...

```{r prac8_addremote, echo=FALSE, out.width = "400pt", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('prac8_images/addremote.png') 
```

18. Click it > Add Remote. Paste in the URL use the remote name origin and the branch name of master --- which you can get from the GitHub Quick setup screen after creating your repo. Check sync the branch with the remote > click create then select overwrite

```{r prac8_addremote2, echo=FALSE, out.width = "400pt", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('prac8_images/addremote2.png') 
```

19. Push the files to your GitHub and they will appear on your GitHub repo

20. Next we need to actually build the site...there are a few ways to do this...Go to the Git tab you should see the Build tab, if you can't then go to Tools > Project Options > Build Tools and select website under Project build tools. Now click Build Website under the build tab

21. Alternatively you write the following in the console 

```{r prac8_render_site, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
rmarkdown::render_site()
```

If you wanted to just build a page from your site --- say if you have made a rather big site with lots of analysis use:

```{r prac8_rendersite2, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
rmarkdown::render_site("index.Rmd")
```

22. Stage, commit and then push the files to your GitHub. I had some issues staging the ```site_libs``` folder in the Git tab. I fixed it by closing and reloading my R project then clicking the cog symbol (under Git tab) > Shell and typing ```git add .``` If you get an error message about the index file being locked... go and delete it and try again. If you can't delete restart the machine and try again. You will find it in the .git folder within your project. Once ```git add .``` runs you should see all the files staged, be able to commit and then push the changes to GitHub

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9282632/git-index-lock-file-exists-when-i-try-to-commit-but-cannot-delete-the-file

23. So your 'built' website is up on GitHub, but you need to tell it where to build the site from...Go to your GitHub repo > Settings, scroll down to GitHub pages and select the Source as the master branch

```{r prac8_githubpages, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800pt", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('prac8_images/GitHubpages.png') 
```

24. Click on the link that is provided where your site is published and you should have a website with two tabs. Here is what mine looks like:

```{r prac8_markdownsite, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800pt", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('prac8_images/Markdownsite.png') 
```

For more information on hosting your code from RStudio on GitHub check out the book [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/usage-intro.html)

My RMarkdown site can be found [at this GitHub pages link](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/PUBLISHEXAMPLE/), but note that i've added a Shiny tab...which is covered in an optional extra.

At this stage, it's important to highlight the need for sensible representations of data and analysis. This especially true with the advent of GitHub and journals publishing data and code meaning it is almost impossible to present false representations of analysis. 

## Warning

Whilst it might seem tempting to use the most advanced interactive maps for your the assignments within this module and course it is important to think and reflect upon the appropriateness of the mapped output. You should ask yourself the following questions:

* What am i trying to show with this map
* Will interative elements aid this in anyway or just confuse users
* Is there a more concise way to display this data
* Do i need all this information --- is it all relevant to the message you are trying to portray with the map

In all these examples i've used the same data (Hotels and Airbnbs in London boroughs), however as i'm only showing two datasets could this be represeted without all this complexity?--- in this case the answer really depends on the audience you are tyring to get something across to. For example, for use in an academic journal, as there are only two data sets being mapped a static map like we produced in the [Map making] practical would be more appropraite. However an interative map (similar to what we have produced) might be more useful for incorpation on a website...

The take home message from this is to critically think about the best way to map and disseminate your data/results.

## Advanced online publishing

Already familiar with RPubs, RMarkdown site generator or even Shiny? Try and and produce an online document using either: bookdown, flexdashboard, blogdown or shinydashboard. These are listed in order of difficutly from my experience. 

**Hint** this document is made using bookdown, so checkout my GitHub for how i set it up

<div class="col2">

* [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/), [minimal bookdown example](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo)

If you want to extend bookdown or automate the process of building, have a look at [continuous integration using github actions](https://www.hvitfeldt.me/blog/bookdown-netlify-github-actions/)

* [Flexdashboard](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/)

* [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)
