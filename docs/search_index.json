This website is hosted on GitHub and holds all the practical instructions and data. Data used within the practicals is available online, however occasionally websites can undergo maintenance or be inaccessible due to political factors such as government shutdowns. Accessing this data is explained in the section hello GIS. Acknowledgement Thanks to the following people who have either contributed directly or provided code in repositories that have helped me style this book: STAT 545 rstudio4edu Hadley Wickham Alison Presmanes Hill Desirée De Leon Yihui Xie Robin Lovelace Twitter for R programmers Matt Ng StatQuest with Josh Starmer Julia Silge Jenny Bryan Garrick AdenBuie The R package and analysis artwork used within this book has been produced by allison_horst, whilst artwork used in information boxes has been produced by Desirée De Leon.

Assignment resources Reading list", " Hello GIS Spatial analysis can yield fascinating insights into geographical relationships. However, at times it can be difficult to work with. You will get lots of error messages and have software crash. The academic staff are here to help you work through these practicals but we do not know everything. Its a good idea to become familar with online sources of help, such as: Stack Exchange RStudio community QGIS documemtation R documentation ArcGIS help pages Want to see what you can do with spatial analysischeck out this Whats Next video produced for the ESRI conference Intended course learning outcomes After having taking this module, you should be able to: Develop a working knowledge of QGIS and R to support the application of GI Science techniques Visualise geographic information through producing appropriate maps to high cartographic standards Carry out spatial data management tasks (joining attribute to geometry data, cleaning data, converting between file formats and spatial reference systems) Interpret data and apply relevant spatial analyses (e.g. auto correlation/hot spot analysis, areal interpolation, point in polygon/buffer analysis, spatial statistical analysis) to answer a variety of spatial problems Explain and evaluate common issues with geographic data such as representation and uncertainty Apply and critique (spatial) statistical analysis techniques to infer relationships between spatial phenomena Experience the diversity of the global spatial data landscape and evaluate the relative drawbacks and merits of different spatial datasets There is a lot of information within this practical book and we do not expect you to read everything we link to. You should attend each lecture, go through every practical and do some associated reading. This is a 15 credit module, equivalent to 150 hours of study (including the taught sessions). Outside of our lectures and practical sessions (3 hours a week) you should be spending an extra 12 hours a week on this module. How to use this book To get the most out of this book spend a few minutes learning how to control it, in the top right of this webpage you will see this tools bar: From left to right these buttons will let you: control the side bar search the entire book for a specific word change the text size, font, colour propose an edit if you see a mistake that I can review view the webpage in the raw RMarkdown format, we cover RMarkdown in the course information about shortcuts for this book and most others like it In addition the icon in the top right of the page takes you to the GitHub repository for this book, we cover GitHub in the course, but its basically where the online files for the book are stored. Getting started One of the issues with GIS is that many of the files we will be working with are quite large. Fortunately in recent years UCL has seriously beefed up the storage available for students. You now get 100GB of free storage, which should be plenty for the work you will be doing this year! The Bartlett faculty has several gigabytes of storage space available on their central servers, so before we get started, we will connect to our N drive to carry out all of our practical work over the coming weeks. The data we use in this practical book is representative of what you will find when conducting independent analysis. Some books and website will give you perfectly clean and ready to use data, we have not done this on purpose as its very important to master data wrangling (also called data manipulation). In the real world data is messy and its vital you know how to deal with it. Take this quote from the New York Times for example Data scientists, according to interviews and expert estimates, spend from 50 percent to 80 percent of their time mired in this more mundane labor of collecting and preparing unruly digital data, before it can be explored for useful nuggets. How to download data and files from GitHub The majority of data required for the workshops is found online and we detail how to download this within the workshops. On occasion you may need to get some data from my GitHub, the workshops will instruct you to do this where needed. To do so you have a few options. Option 1 will let you download just a spceific folder whilst option 2 will download everything i have used to make the workshops. Option 1 Use DownGit Go to: https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home Head over to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/andrewmaclachlan/CASA0005repo Select a folder you wish to download  here ill use practical data as the example, click into the folder (prac7_data) and copy the url: https://github.com/andrewmaclachlan/CASA0005repo/tree/master/prac7_data Paste it into DownGit and click Download, once downloaded then unzip the folder. Option 2 Go to the online repository page here: https://github.com/andrewmaclachlan/CASA0005repo Click Clone or download, the download as ZIP. This will download the everything i have used to make this website including all the data for the practicals Self guided learning The lectures and practicals of this course only form a part of the learning process. You are expected to undertake wider reading and explore new methods and approaches. We have provided guidance on useful resources throughout the course to use as a starting point but you are encouraged to go beyond our recommedations and fully engage with applied GIS research, methods and visualisation techniques. If you find a practical particularly easy or straightforward then please move on to the next one. Practicals that look at analytical relationships also have extension activities for you to try. Interactive lectures During the lectures we will be using an interative polling and Q&amp;A application called vevox. Its very simple to use, you can either: Download the app on iOS or Android: http://get.vevox.app Use the web app: https://vevox.app/ The meeting ID we will use is: 186-395-009 More help If you need specific assistance with this course please: Check the Moodle assessment tab for queries relating to assignments / deadlines. There is also an expected assignment timeline and frequently asked questions section within the assessment outline document. Speak to a member of the teaching team in the computer lab sessions Ask a question at the end of a lecture (time permitting) Ask a question on slack under the GIS channel you should have recevied an invite email from Steve Gray otherwise use this link. The teaching team will monitor this  use the #gis channel for this course. Due to the size of the class we will only reply to messages on slack so all students can see the discussion. If you have a personal matter in relation to completing the course then please speak to or email Andy or Adam. If you are struggling to use R dont worryhere is some advice from a tweet and interview with Hadley Wickham, chief scientist at RStudio You're doing it right if you get frustrated: if you're not frustrated, you're (probably) not stretching yourself mentally  Hadley Wickham ((hadleywickham?)) 11. Februar 2015 Its easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, Oh its me, Im really stupid, or, Im not made out to program. But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. Its just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Dont blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later. You can also go through other free resources including: Free RStudio Education resources Codeacademy YaRrr! The Pirates Guide to R At the end of every practical there is a link anonymous Google feeback form, let us know if something is unclear and we will go over it in a future session. If after pursuing all these avenues you still need help you can book into our office hours. These meetings are to discuss a geographical concept in relation to the material/assessment or for any personal matters relevant to the completion of the module. These meetings are not to be used for specific technical issues. Problems of this nature should be addressed in the practical sessions. Andy Adam If you give us minimal information in this form (e.g. one word) we will cancel the meeting. Noticed a mistake? No one is perfect, if you notice a mistake let us know through the GitHub issues tab Dont worry if you are unsure about what GitHub is we cover it in the course. Assignment resources Want some tips for resources on your assignment?. head over to the Assignment resources pages Reading list We link to books and resources throughout each practical and in the Assignment resources pages, but a full reading list for the course is provided on the UCL library reading list page for the course, there is also a link to it over on Moodle. Weve tried to mostly recommend open source and free books, any others are available from the library. "],["software-installation.html", "Software installation QGIS R ArcGIS", " Software installation This course primarily uses the R data science programming language and we strongly advise you complete the assignment using it. We briefly touch upon QGIS to give you a basic foundation in the range of spatial software available, please follow the instructions below before the first practical session to install the software on your local computer if you are planning to use it throughout the course. QGIS QGIS is an open-source garphic user interface GIS with many community developed add on packages that (or plugins) that provide additional functionality to the software. To get QGIS on your personal machine go to: https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html I install the OSGeo4W version. The nature of open-source means that several programs will rely on each other for features. OSGeo4W tracks all the shared requirements and does not install any duplicates. R R is both a programming language and software environment, originally designed for statistical computing and graphics. Rs great strength is that it is open-source, can be used on any computer operating system and free for anyone to use and contribute to. Because of this, it is rapidly becoming the statistical language of choice for many academics and has a huge user community with people constantly contributing new packages to carry out all manner of statistical, graphical and importantly for us, geographical tasks. Setup 1 Search for and open RStudio. You can install R Studio on your own machine from: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download R studio requires R which you can download from: https://cran.rstudio.com/ RStudio is a free and open-source integrated development environment for R  it makes R much easier to use. If you are using a Mac and run into issues, firstly follow the instructions below then check out the [Mac R issues] section if the problem persists. Setup 2 UCL students (and staff) can now also make use of R Studio Server. Its RStudio on a webpage, so no installation is required. Access information will be provided on Moodle and in the lectures. ArcGIS As ArcGIS is not open source and from my experience analysis within it is largely not reproducible and therefore it is not included within this practical book. If you are interested in it please consult previous iterations of this course. You will find tutorials on: Joining data, Map Making and Spatial Patterns. "]]
